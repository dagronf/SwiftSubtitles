## Basic usage

### Decoding

Basic decoding uses the file extension to determine the coder to use when decoding.

```swift
let subtitles = try Subtitles(fileURL: <some file url>)
subtitles.cues.forEach { cue in
	// Do something with 'cue'
}
```

You can also instantiate a coder object and use that directly if you know the type of subtitles you'll be decoding

```swift
let subtitleContent = ...
let coder = Subtitles.Coder.SBV()
let subtitles = try coder.decode(subtitleContent)
...
let encodedContent = try coder.encode(subtitles: subtitles)
``` 

### Encoding

```swift
let cue1 = Subtitles.Cue(
	position: 1,
	startTime: Subtitles.Time(minute: 10),
	endTime: Subtitles.Time(minute: 11),
	text: "점점 더 많아지는\n시민들의 성난 목소리로..."
)

let cue2 = Subtitles.Cue(
	position: 2,
	startTime: Subtitles.Time(minute: 13, second: 5),
	endTime: Subtitles.Time(minute: 15, second: 10, millisecond: 101),
	text: "Second entry"
)

let subtitles = Subtitles([cue1, cue2])

// Encode based on the subtitle file extension
let content = try Subtitles.encode(subtitles, fileExtension: "srt")

// Encode using an explicit coder
let coder = Subtitles.Coder.VTT()
let content2 = try coder.encode(subtitles: subtitles)
```

## Resources

### Podcast Index Transcript

Format is documented [here](https://github.com/Podcastindex-org/podcast-namespace/blob/main/transcripts/transcripts.md#json)

### Lyrics file format

Format is documented [here](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/LRC_(file_format))

The format defines the sub-second timing as 'hundredths of a second', however some online sample files use milliseconds
instead. This encoder supports both for decoding, and the encoder supports both formats when writing.

```
[00:12.41]Is it that sweet? I guess so
[00:12.419]Is it that sweet? I guess so
```

### CSV coding/encoding

There appears to be no formal CSV specification for subtitles, so this coder tries to make a generic "enough" encoder/decoder to make it easier for an app to export into a spreadsheet or google docs.

<details>
<summary>Click here for more details on supported CSV formats</summary>

The CSV must conform to [RFC 4180](https://www.rfc-editor.org/rfc/rfc4180.html)

* Text that contains double-quotes must be double-double-quoted (eg. ">> ALICE: My cat is named ""cat"" and is quite arrogant")
* Text containing newlines must be encapsulated in quotes. (eg. ">> ALICE: What about you?\n>> ROB: I don't have an opinion")

This library uses [TinyCSV](https://github.com/dagronf/TinyCSV) for CSV coding/decoding.

During decoding, the coder ignores the header if it exists, and assumes a particular ordering for the columns

By default, the encoder/decoder assumes a `<position>, <start-time>, <end-time>, <text>` format, however this
can be configured in the coder's initializer.

#### Time formats supported for decoding

* SBV style: `00:00:00.000`
* SRT style: `00:00:00,000`
* Common style: `00:00:00:000`
* milliseconds: `102727`

#### Examples using common style text formats

```
No.,Timecode In,Timecode Out,Subtitle
1, 00:00:00:599, 00:00:04.160, ">> ALICE: Hi, my name is Alice Miller and this is John Brown"
2, 00:00:04:160, 00:00:06.770, ">> JOHN: and we're the owners of ""Miller Bakery""."
```

```
Position,Start time,End Time,Text
51,00:00:00:599,00:00:04.160,">> ALICE: Hi, my name is Alice Miller and this is John Brown"
52,00:00:04:160,00:00:06.770,">> JOHN: and we're the owners of ""Miller Bakery""."
```

#### An example using millisecond durations and containing line feeds within the text

```
1, 91216, 93093, "РегалВю ТЕЛЕМАРКЕТИНГ
АНДЕРСЪН - МЕНИДЖЪР"
2, 102727, 104562, "Тук пише, че 5 години сте бил"
3, 104646, 107232, "мениджър на ресторант ""Ръсти Скапър""."
```

## Limitations

* Some VTT functionality is not supported (NOTE, STYLE, REGION). These will be discarded on import. 
* Lyrics (LRC) file import discards ID tags.
* Lyrics (LRC) file _export_ discards end times (LRC file format only supports start times)
